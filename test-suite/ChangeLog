2001-08-08  Marius Vollmer  <marius.vollmer@uni-dortmund.de>

	* Makefile.am (TESTS): List tests explicitely instead of using a

	* lib.scm (exception:unbound-var, exception:wrong-num-args):  New
	exported constants.

2001-03-01  Dirk Herrmann  <D.Herrmann@tu-bs.de>

	* tests/symbols.test:  New file.

	(exception:immutable-string):  New constant.  Currently, this is a
	dummy since guile does not have immutable strings.

	* tests/exceptions.test, tests/strings.test, tests/symbols.test:
	Moved the string related test cases from tests/exceptions.test to
	tests/strings.test and the symbol related test cases to
	tests/symbols.test.

	* tests/strings.test:  Copyright notice updated.  Added a couple

	(exception:immutable-string):  New constant.  Currently, this is a
	dummy since guile does not have immutable strings.

	* tests/exceptions.test:  Use expect-fail-exception to indicate
	test cases where exceptions should occur, but don't.

	(catch-error-returning-true, pass-if-not,
	catch-error-returning-false):  Removed.  The macro pass-if-not was
	not used.  The macro catch-error-returning-false is unnecessary
	since exceptions are caught by the test-suite anyway.  The
	functionality of catch-error-returning-true is provided by the new
	convenience macro pass-if-exception.

	* tests/hooks.test (exception:wrong-num-hook-args):  New constant.
	Maybe a standard wrong-num-arg exception should be thrown instead
	of a misc-error?

	* tests/reader.test (try-to-read):  Replaced by read-string.

	* tests/alist.test, tests/environments.test, tests/eval.test,

	and-let*).

2001-01-26  Dirk Herrmann  <D.Herrmann@tu-bs.de>

	This patch fixes things that I have broken with the last one :-(

	* guile-test (test-suite):  New variable.

	(data-file-name):  New function.  Has the same purpose as the
	former function data-file from lib.scm.  Moved here in order to
	have all file name handling at the same place.  In contrast to the
	former 'data-file function, it is not checked whether a file
	exists.  This allows to use this function also for file names of
	files that are still to be created.

	(test-file-name):  Use the global 'test-suite variable.

	(main):  Initialize 'test-suite instead of a local variable.

	* lib.scm:  Don't import paths any more.

	(data-file):  Removed.  Resurrected with a sligtly different
	functionality as 'data-file-name' in guile-test.

	* r4rs.scm:  For all references to temporary file, make use of
	data-file-name.

2001-01-26  Dirk Herrmann  <D.Herrmann@tu-bs.de>

	The following patch was sent by Thien-Thi Nguyen and a little bit
	modified by me.

	* guile-test:  Usage and installation comments improved.  Added
	support for --test-suite and --debug command line options.

	(default-test-suite):  Added to allow for simplified
	configurability.  No need to load the paths file any more.

	(enable-debug-mode):  New function.  Will be called when the
	--debug command line option is given.

	(test-root):  Removed.  The test directory has to be fully given.
	This allows for arbitrarily named test directories.

	(test-file-name, enumerate-tets):  Take the test directory as a
	paramter instead of using the global variable 'test-root'.

	(main):  Handle the new command line options.  Return an exit code
	depending on whether all tests came out as expected.

	* README:  Updated.

	* paths.scm:  Removed.

2001-01-24  Gary Houston  <ghouston@arglist.com>

	* tests/ports.test: include (ice-9 rdelim) module.

2001-01-18  Dirk Herrmann  <D.Herrmann@tu-bs.de>

	and friends need fixing.

2000-09-12  Dirk Herrmann  <D.Herrmann@tu-bs.de>

	* tests/environments.test:  For tests that rely on garbage
	collection, conservative scanning can be a problem.  Add a comment
	for these tests and make them turn out unresolved if things don't
	work as expected.

2000-09-05  Dirk Herrmann  <D.Herrmann@tu-bs.de>

	* tests/environments.test:  Finished and cleaned up the tests for
	the leaf environments.  Added a complete set of testcases for the

	* tests/eval.test:  Added.

2000-06-16  Dirk Herrmann  <D.Herrmann@tu-bs.de>

	* tests/list.test:  Use cons* instead of list*.

2000-06-13  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@thalamus.nada.kth.se>

	documentation module.

2000-05-26  Dirk Herrmann  <D.Herrmann@tu-bs.de>

	* tests/hooks.test:  make-hook-with-name is deprecated.

2000-05-08  Dirk Herrmann  <D.Herrmann@tu-bs.de>

	* guile-test:  Eliminate use of catch-test-errors.

	* lib.scm:  Adopted a couple of nice ideas from Greg.

	(pass, fail, expect-failure, expect-failure-if,
	expect-failure-if*, catch-test-errors, catch-test-errors*,
	expected-failure-fluid, pessimist?):  Removed.

	(run-test, expect-fail, result-tags, important-result-tags):
	Added.

	(report, make-count-reporter, print-counts, make-log-reporter,
	full-reporter, user-reporter):  Reporters take two mandatory
	arguments and make use of the tag descriptions in result-tags and
	important-result-tags.

	* tests/alist.test, tests/hooks.test, tests/ports.test,
	tests/weaks.test:  Don't use catch-test-errors and
	expect-failure-if.

2000-05-05  Dirk Herrmann  <D.Herrmann@tu-bs.de>

	* mambo.test:  Removed dummy file.

2000-03-31  Gary Houston  <ghouston@arglist.com>

	* tests/ports.test (non-blocking-I/O): a couple more details:
	a) combine the O_NONBLOCK flag with the default flags instead
	of replacing them.  b) check EWOULDBLOCK as well as EAGAIN.

2000-03-22  Jim Blandy  <jimb@savonarola.red-bean.com>

	* lib.scm: Doc fixes.

Sun Jan 16 14:01:51 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* paths.scm: Assume that ~/guile-core/test-suite is the location
	of the test suite now.

	* tests/version.test: Added -- version.c had 0% coverage before,
	now at 100%.

Fri Dec 17 12:14:10 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* tests/c-api.test: Refine the list of files that are checked in
	the seek-offset-test.  Was just using files that end in "c", but
	that caught the new ".doc" files, too, so make sure that files end
	in ".c" before requiring that they include unistd.h if they
	reference SEEK_(SET|CUR|END).

1999-10-24  Gary Houston  <ghouston@freewire.co.uk>

	* tests/ports.test ("string ports"): test seeking/unreading from
	an input string and seeking an output string.

1999-10-20  Gary Houston  <ghouston@freewire.co.uk>

	* tests/ports.test: in seek/tell test on input port, also test
	that ftell doesn't discard unread chars.

1999-10-18  Gary Houston  <ghouston@freewire.co.uk>

	* tests/ports.test: add seek/tell tests for unidirectional ports.

1999-09-25  Jim Blandy  <jimb@savonarola.red-bean.com>

	* tests/reader.test: Check that number->string checks its radix
	properly.

1999-09-20  Jim Blandy  <jimb@savonarola.red-bean.com>

	* tests/ports.test: Check that our input functions cope when
	current-input-port is closed.

	* tests/regexp.test: Check regexp-substitute/global when there are
	no matches.  (Duh.)

1999-09-15  Mikael Djurfeldt  <mdj@thalamus.nada.kth.se>

	* tests/c-api.test: New file.  Add test to check that all source
	files which use SEEK_SET, SEEK_CUR, and SEEK_END include unistd.h.

1999-09-14  Gary Houston  <ghouston@freewire.co.uk>

	* tests/ports.test: test non-blocking I/O.

	* tests/interp.test: Added tests for evaluation of closure bodies.

1999-09-03  James Blandy  <jimb@mule.m17n.org>

	* tests/multilingual.nottest: New file, which we will turn into a
	test file once we actually have multilingual support to test.

	* tests/load.test: New test file.

1999-08-30  James Blandy  <jimb@mule.m17n.org>

	* tests/strings.test: New test file.

1999-08-29  Gary Houston  <ghouston@easynet.co.uk>

	* tests/ports.test: test unread-char and unread-string.

1999-08-19  Gary Houston  <ghouston@easynet.co.uk>

	* tests/ports.test: test line-buffering of fports.

1999-08-18  Gary Houston  <ghouston@easynet.co.uk>

	* tests/ports.test: tests for NUL and non-ASCII chars to fports.

1999-08-12  Gary Houston  <ghouston@easynet.co.uk>

	* tests/ports.test: tests for buffered and unbuffered input/output
	fports with seeking.

1999-08-01  Jim Blandy  <jimb@savonarola.red-bean.com>

	* tests/r4rs.test (SECTION 3 4): Each element of type-matrix
	corresponds to an example object, not a predicate.  Aubrey
	probably never noticed this because SCM doesn't check the lengths
	of the arguments to for-each and map...

	* tests/ports.test: Add some regression tests for char-ready?.

1999-07-19  Jim Blandy  <jimb@savonarola.red-bean.com>

	* tests/ports.test: Fix copyright years.

	* tests/guardians.test: New test file.

	* tests/time.test: New test file.

	* tests/r4rs.test: New set of tests, taken from Guile's test
	script, taken from SCM.

	* tests/ports.test: Group the string port tests under a new
	test name prefix.

	* tests/ports.test ("line counter"): Check the final column, too.

	* lib.scm: Import (test-suite paths).
	(data-file): New exported function.

1999-06-12  Jim Blandy  <jimb@savonarola.red-bean.com>

	* tests/ports.test ("line counter"): Add test for correct column
	at EOF.

1999-06-09  Jim Blandy  <jimb@savonarola.red-bean.com>

	* tests/ports.test ("line counter"): Verify that we do eventually
	get EOF on the port --- don't just read forever.

	* lib.scm (full-reporter): The test name is the cadr of the
	result, not the cdr.  I'm not macho enough to handle run-time
	typechecking.

	* lib.scm (print-counts): XFAILS are "expected failures", not
	"unexpected failures."

	* lib.scm, guile-test, paths.scm: Log begins.
