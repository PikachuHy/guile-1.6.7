Each night, we make the current Guile sources available in a convenient
to download tarball.  Please keep in mind that these sources are
strictly experimental; they will usually not be well-tested, and may
not even compile on some systems.  They may contain interfaces which
will change.  They will usually not be of sufficient quality for use by
people not comfortable hacking the innards of Guile.  Caveat!

However, we're providing them anyway for several reasons.  We'd like to
encourage people to get involved in developing Guile.  People willing
to use the bleeding edge of development can get earlier access to new,
experimental features.  Patches submitted relative to recent snapshots
will be easier for us to evaluate and install, since the patch's
original sources will be closer to what we're working with.  And it
allows us to start testing features earlier.

anonymous FTP from:
